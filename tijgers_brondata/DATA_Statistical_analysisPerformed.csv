Statistical analysis
We considered depredation rates (domestic versus wild) in relation to 3 landscape characteristics: management zone (core versus buffer zones), within and beyond 2 km of villages, and within and beyond 250 m of water sources. 
"In the first analysis, prey (domestic or wild) was the dependent variable, while zone (buffer/core), generation (first generation = mature adults; second generation = young adults) and sex (male/female) of tigers, and season (summer, rainy, winter) were included as independent variables. In the second analysis, we included “Distance,” which was the distance from the core zone boundary to kill location and “near villages” (inside/outside 2 km of villages, which are high human density areas) as independent variables. In the third analysis, we used “water” and “near water” (inside/outside 250 m of water body) as the independent variables (rather than those of village). "
All analyses were performed using generalised linear models (GLMs) in R 2.12.0 [31]. Adequate model fits were ensured by the stepwise removal of non-significant (significance p < 0.05) three-way and two-way interactions. We optimised the model based on all main effects and by only using the three–way and two-way interactions that were significant (See S1 Table  for coefficients and the model selection procedure).
